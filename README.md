# Mass-Defect-Calculator
Ever wanted to calculate Mass Defect? Neither do I, so I made this in order to do it for me :)

It's obviously not perfect and can be improved, so if you're able to make it better please do so

I've updated this frequently for a while, but I think I've reached a point where I can't improve a whole lot

Might include Linux install instructions in the future? idk, I might if/when it gets more attention
